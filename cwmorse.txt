decode morse code with keras

limited training set at first:
- [CQ] <callsign>
- <callsign> [73 | RRR]
- <callsign> <gridsquare>
- <callsign> [R][+-]<num>
- noise or random letters

<callsign>:
	\d?[A-Z]{1,2}\d{1,4}[A-Z]{1,4}
	(type 1/2 compound callsigns?)

input: normalized spectral data (do we need I/Q?)
what if signal spans 2 bins? (take most likely bin? use adjacent bins?)
50% overlap fft?

T = 1200/WPM = 17 msec ~= 20 msec
downsample to 10 msec (100 samples/sec)
- wspr is 375 frames/sec
random slice
need about 200 bits for input
handle up to 15 chars - 750?

output: [ A-Z0-9+-/]
0-15 chars

dot = 1/1
dash = 3/1
space = 3
word = 7

variability? maybe 0-30%?
